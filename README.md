# Colourizing-Black-White-Images

This project is to convert grayscale (black and white images) to coloured images with the help of Generative Adversarial Networks. In this project a mini version of pix2pix was implemented without the adversarial loss. This uses only crossentropy loss. The model was trained on a publicly available aquarium dataset of 448 images (already uploaded) and resized to 256, 256 for easier computational purposes.

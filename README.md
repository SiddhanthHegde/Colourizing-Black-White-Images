# Colourizing-Black-White-Images

This project is to convert grayscale (black and white images) to coloured images with the help of Generative Adversarial Networks. In this project Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGAN) was used. Wassertian GAN (WGAN) was also tried but DCGAN was more helpful as there was no problem of mode collapse. The model was trained on a publicly available aquarium dataset of 448 images (already uploaded) and resized to 256, 256 for easier computational purposes. Future work includes applying Style GANs and pix2pix models for better results and better incep scores.
